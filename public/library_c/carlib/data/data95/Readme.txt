                         These data were compiled at the
                            Chair of Thermodynamics
                            Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum

The compilation is based on the information given in the article

Wagner, W. and Pruﬂ, A., The IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties
of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data
31 (2002), 387-535.

The folders in the directory contain the experimental data for different thermodynamic
properties which were used to develop the IAPWS-95 formulation. Only the selected
points are listed (see Tables 4.1 to 4.9 of article on IAPWS-95 mentioned above).


The following properties are included (see Table 5.4 of the article on IAPWS-95):

In some directories are subfolders called "comparison". They contain data which 
were only available after the development of the IAPWS-95 formulation had been 
finished. These data were used to check how IAPWS-95 represents these data of the 
corresponding thermodynamic properties.

Calculated values of different properties as listed in Table 5.4 were not included
in this compilation.

In only a few datasets there are small differences between the number of data given 
in the tables mentioned above and the number of data available in the datafiles.
These datasets are listed below.

According to the data used when developing IAPWS-95 the number of significant figures
given for temperatures of the saturated properties and of the properties in the 
homogeneous region are different.
