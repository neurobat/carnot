function x = rel_hum2x(t, p, hum)
% x = rel_hum2x(t, p, hum) calculates the water mass per dry air mass from 
% the relative humidity.
% input:    t - temperature in degree Celsius
%           p - pressure in Pa
%           hum - relative humidity in percent
% output:   x - humidity in kg water / kg dry air
