function h = x2rel_hum(t, p, x)
% x2rel_hum(t, p, x) calculates the relative humidity in percent from the
% water mass per dry air mass.
% Inputs:
%     t - temperature in degree centigrade
%     p - pressure in Pa
%     x - water content in kg water / kg dry air
%
% The calculation is carried out in the S-function vapourpressure    
% which is part of the library Carlib
%
% See also CARLIB, rel_hum2x
